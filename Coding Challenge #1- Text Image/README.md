# Coding Challenge #1 - Text Image

## Problem Statement

I attempt to encode an image into a text file so I can load it into a web page. I also attempt to decode the text file back into an image. It is to understand how pixels work and how to manipulate them in P5.js.

## To run the code

Download the [final project](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzinsy23%2FCoding-Challenges%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FCoding%2520Challenge%2520%25231-%2520Text%2520Image%2FText%2520Image%2520Part%25203) file. You can also choose to download [part 2](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzinsy23%2FCoding-Challenges%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FCoding%2520Challenge%2520%25231-%2520Text%2520Image%2FText%2520Image%2520Part%25202) or [part 1](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzinsy23%2FCoding-Challenges%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FCoding%2520Challenge%2520%25231-%2520Text%2520Image%2FText%2520Image%2520Part%25201) instead if you want to follow along with any other part.

It's recommended to use node.js to run the code. In the part you downloaded, you can go to the program folder and run the following from that directory:
```bash
node server.js
```

This will start a local server and it will run on port 8001. You can use it as I use it in the video.
